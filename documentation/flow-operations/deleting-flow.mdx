The `delete_flow(flow_id: str)` method deletes a specified flow.

### Example

```python
import asyncio
from mira_sdk import MiraClient

async def delete_a_flow():
    # Initialize the client
    client = MiraClient(
        base_url="https://api.mira.example.com",
        api_token="your-api-token"
    )

    # Delete a specific flow
    flow_id = "flow1"
    await client.delete_flow(flow_id)
    print(f"Flow {flow_id} deleted successfully.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(delete_a_flow())
```

### Output

```plaintext
Flow flow1 deleted successfully.
```
