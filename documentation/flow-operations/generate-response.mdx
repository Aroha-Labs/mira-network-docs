The `generate_with_flow(flow_id: str, request: FlowChatCompletion)` method uses a flow to generate a response.

### Example

```python
import asyncio
from mira_sdk import MiraClient, FlowChatCompletion, Message

async def generate_with_flow():
    # Initialize the client
    client = MiraClient(
        base_url="https://api.mira.example.com",
        api_token="your-api-token"
    )

    # Create a FlowChatCompletion request
    flow_id = "flow1"
    request = FlowChatCompletion(
        messages=[
            Message(role="user", content="What is the weather today?")
        ]
    )

    # Generate response
    response = await client.generate_with_flow(flow_id, request)
    print("Generated response:", response)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(generate_with_flow())
```

### Output

```plaintext
Generated response: "The weather today is sunny with a high of 25Â°C."
```
