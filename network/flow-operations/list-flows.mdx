<Note>Since the testnet is on Beta, the flow operations can be unstable.</Note>

The `list_flows()` method retrieves a list of all flows associated with your account.

### Example

```python Python
import asyncio
from mira_sdk import MiraClient

async def list_all_flows():
    # Initialize the client
    client = MiraClient(
        base_url="https://api.mira.example.com",
        api_token="your-api-token"
    )

    # Fetch and print all flows
    flows = await client.list_flows()
    print("Available flows:", flows)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(list_all_flows())
```

### Output

```plaintext
Available flows: ['flow1', 'flow2', 'flow3']
```
