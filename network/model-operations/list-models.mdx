from mira_network import MiraClient

async def explore_models():
    async with MiraClient(api_key="your-api-key") as client:
        # Get list of available models
        models = await client.list_models()
        print("Available models:", models)

        # Get detailed information about models
        for model in models:
            print(f"\nModel: {model}")
            # You can use this model ID in chat_completions_create()
```

### Response Structure

```python
[
    "gpt-4o",
    "claude-3.5-sonnet",
