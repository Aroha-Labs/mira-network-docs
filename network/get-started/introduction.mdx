## What is Mira SDK?

Welcome to the Mira SDK Documentation! This guide will help you seamlessly integrate the Mira Network API into your Python applications using the Mira SDK. Whether you're working on model inference, managing AI workflows, or tracking credits, the Mira SDK provides a simple and efficient way to interact with the Mira Network API.

The Mira SDK is a Python library designed to interface with the Mira Network API. It simplifies complex operations into straightforward methods and ensures robust type validation using Pydantic models. With the Mira SDK, you can easily access:

- **Model Inference**: Utilize advanced AI models like `mira/llama3.1` for tasks such as text generation, classification, and more.
- **Flow Management**: Create, update, and manage AI workflows with ease.
- **Credit System**: Monitor and manage usage credits efficiently.

## Key Features

- **Asynchronous API**: Built with `httpx` to enable non-blocking, high-performance operations.
- **Full Type Support**: Benefit from type hints and Pydantic-based models for reliable request and response validation.
- **Comprehensive API Coverage**: Access all Mira API endpoints, including:
  - Model Operations
  - Flow Operations
  - Token Management
  - Credit System

## Getting Started

To start using the Mira SDK, you'll need:

1. **Python Environment**: Python 3.8 or higher is recommended.
2. **Mira API Access**: Obtain your API token by signing up on the Mira Network platform.
3. **Installation**: Install the Mira SDK via pip (see [Installation](/documentation/get-started/installation) for detailed instructions).

Once you've completed the prerequisites, you can explore the SDK's functionality with the [Quick Start](#) guide and dive into advanced features via the [API Reference](#).
