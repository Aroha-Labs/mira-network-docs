The `get_credits_history()` method retrieves a history of all credit transactions, including additions and usage.

### Example

```python Python
import asyncio
from mira_sdk import MiraClient

async def get_credit_history():
    # Initialize the client
    client = MiraClient(
        base_url="https://api.mira.example.com",
        api_token="your-api-token"
    )

    # Fetch credit history
    history = await client.get_credits_history()
    print("Credit History:", history)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(get_credit_history())
```

### Output

The output will show a list of credit transactions:

```plaintext
Credit History: [
    {"transaction_id": "txn123", "amount": 50, "type": "add", "date": "2025-01-01"},
    {"transaction_id": "txn124", "amount": -10, "type": "usage", "date": "2025-01-02"}
]
```
