## Credit History

Track your credit usage and transactions over time using the `get_credits_history()` method.

### Example

```python
from mira_network import MiraClient

async def view_credit_history():
    async with MiraClient(api_key="your-api-key") as client:
        history = await client.get_credits_history()
        
        for transaction in history:
            print(f"Transaction: {transaction}")
```

### Response Structure

```python
[
    {
        "amount": 10.50,          # Amount in USD
        "description": "Used 1000 tokens with gpt-4o model"
    },
    {
        "amount": 50.00,          # Amount in USD
        "description": "Credit recharge"
    }
    // ... more transactions
]
```
