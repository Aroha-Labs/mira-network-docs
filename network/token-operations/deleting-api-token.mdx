The `delete_api_token(token: str)` method removes an API token, revoking its access to your account.

### Example

```python Python
import asyncio
from mira_sdk import MiraClient

async def delete_api_token():
    # Initialize the client
    client = MiraClient(
        base_url="https://api.mira.example.com",
        api_token="your-api-token"
    )

    # Delete the token
    token_to_delete = "abcd1234efgh5678"
    await client.delete_api_token(token_to_delete)
    print(f"API Token {token_to_delete} has been deleted.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(delete_api_token())
```

### Output

The output confirms the token deletion:

```plaintext
API Token abcd1234efgh5678 has been deleted.
```

## Summary

- Use `create_api_token(request: ApiTokenRequest)` to generate new API tokens.
- Use `list_api_tokens()` to retrieve all existing tokens.
- Use `delete_api_token(token: str)` to revoke and remove an API token.

With these methods, you can effectively manage your API tokens, ensuring secure and organized access to your Mira Network account.
