## Delete API Token

Revoke access by deleting API tokens using the `delete_api_token()` method.

### Example

```python
from mira_network import MiraClient

async def delete_token():
    async with MiraClient(api_key="your-api-key") as client:
        # Delete specific token
        await client.delete_api_token("token-id")
        print("Token successfully deleted")
```

### Error Handling

```python
try:
    await client.delete_api_token("token-id")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error deleting token: {e}")
```

### Usage Notes

- Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone
- Verify token ID before deletion
- Plan for service disruption if deleting active tokens
```
