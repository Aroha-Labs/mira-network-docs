Composio allows you to connect your Mira Flows with various external services and platforms, enabling automated actions based on your flow outputs. This integration bridges the gap between AI-powered flows and real-world actions.

<Warning>
  Composio tool requires Anthropic Claude-3.5-sonnet to function. Check out [Models](/documentation/get-started/models) for more information.
</Warning>

## Step-by-Step Integration Guide

### 1. Set Up Platform Integration

First, let's set up your desired platform integration in Composio:

1. Visit [Composio](https://composio.dev/)

2. Sign in to your account & Navigate to "All Tools"

3. Search for your desired integration (e.g., Twitter, Discord, Telegram)

4. Complete the integration process and authorise your account

### 2. Obtain Integration Details

After setting up the integration, you'll need 3 key pieces of information:

1. **API Key**:

   * Go to your Composio dashboard

   * Look for the API key section at top and copy your API key.

   * You can use the default API key or create a new one

2. **Enum**:

   * Go to the actions of the app you want to integrate with&#x20;

   * Copy the "Enum" of the action you wish to perform

3. **Entity ID**:

   * This is generated after you complete the platform integration

   * Find it in your "connected accounts" section under tools

### 3. Step by Step Demo

Here's an interactive demo showing the process:

## Code Implementation

### ComposioConfig Attributes

| Attribute          | Description                                                       | Required |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| COMPOSIO\_API\_KEY | Your Composio authentication key                                  | Yes      |
| ACTION             | Platform-specific action (e.g., "TWITTER\_POST", "DISCORD\_SEND") | Yes      |
| TASK               | Natural language description including `{content}` placeholder    | Yes      |
| ENTITY\_ID         | Platform-specific entity identifier                               | Yes      |

### Code Example

```python
from mira_sdk import MiraClient, Flow, ComposioConfig

# Initialize Mira client with your API key
client = MiraClient(config={"API_KEY": "YOUR_MIRA_API_KEY"})

# Get your exisitng flow
version = "1.0.0"
input_data = {"key": "value"}

# If no version is provided, latest version is used by default
if version:
    flow = f"author/your-flow-name/{version}"
else:
    flow = "author/your-flow-name"

# Set up your flow's input parameters
input_dict = {
    "input": "value"
}

# Execute flow with Composio integration
# The flow's output will automatically replace {content} in the TASK
response = client.flow.execute(
    flow,
    input_dict,
    ComposioConfig(
        COMPOSIO_API_KEY="YOUR_COMPOSIO_API_KEY",
        ACTION="ENUM",  # This is the Enum e.g., "TWITTER_POST", "DISCORD_SEND"
        TASK="Describe your task in natural language - {content}",  # {content} is required and gets replaced with flow output
        ENTITY_ID="YOUR_ENTITY_ID"  # Platform-specific identifier
    )
)
```

### What Not to Do

1. Don't forget `{content}` in TASK:

```python
# ❌ Incorrect - missing {content}
TASK="Post this message"

# ✅ Correct
TASK="Post this message: {content}"
```

1. Don't modify the `{content}` placeholder:

```python
# ❌ Incorrect
TASK="Send {message}"
TASK="Post {text}"

# ✅ Correct
TASK="Send {content}"
```

1. Don't use multiple `{content}` placeholders:

```python
# ❌ Incorrect
TASK="Post {content} and then {content}"

# ✅ Correct
TASK="Post {content}"
```
